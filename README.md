### Hey there!

I'm Sawyer Belair, a soon-to-graduate journalism student (and recovering former physics student) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Although my prospective career in STEM never panned out, my dream has remained the same since those early days, albeit with a widened lens: to reign in complex, fascinating topics and make them digestible for the average person, and to show how issues halfway around the globe can affect each of us in tangible ways. 

Above all else, I'm seeking to recognize the complexity of issues affecting regular people, instead of reducing them into binary, divisive litmus tests of pre-packaged political ideology. I strive to bring an analytical approach to my work, even in stories where hard numbers might not apply. Sometimes, it's easy to lose sight of real-life experiences in the presence of so many numbers, and so perhaps most importantly, I'm striving to maintain the deeply human aspects embedded in every story. 

I'm also working on innovating novel applications of simple technology in the realm of data journalism, most recently in cooperation with UNL Professor Matt Waite on sensor-encoding project seeking to visualize the physical experience of attending large-crowd activities, such as sporting events and concerts.

Here's a couple of my favorite pieces I've done far:

* Investigating the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's [response](https://journalstar.com/news/local/education/how-unl-instructors-are-tackling-the-emergence-of-chatgpt-and-other-ai-in-higher-education/article_b896666b-b13b-5078-986f-0b3b8c409879.html) to the emergence of ChatGPT and other machine-learning technology in higher education.
* A one-year [retrospective](https://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/students-reflect-on-fall-2021-fiji-protests-ongoing-challenges-facing-unl/article_e4fe207a-48ea-11ed-8537-b36945a30db1.html) on the response to allegations of sexual assault of a 17-year-old girl at a fraternity house on campus, which sparked nationwide outrage.
* [Linking](https://norfolkdailynews.com/news/global-food-shortage-leaves-local-nonprofit-high-and-dry/article_f74cd86e-dd03-11ec-bb4a-5b57750fe06d.html) the war in Ukraine and subsequent global grain shortages to the struggles of a Norfolk, NE-based non-profit's efforts to feed the hungry across the world.
* A [debate](https://norfolkdailynews.com/news/conflicting-camps-debate-merits-of-medical-marijuana-legalization-in-nebraska-ahead-of-petition-deadline/article_84d8f4fa-fa10-11ec-a91c-e75f5e1ee325.html) surrounding a petition drive to legalize medical marijuana in Nebraska in the summer of 2022.
* Currently, I've been working on a data-centered investigation into train derailments in Nebraska, linking the trend to recent derailments in the state as well as the disaster in East Palestine, OH. Stay tuned!
