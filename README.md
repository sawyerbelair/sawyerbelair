### Hey there!

I'm Sawyer Belair, a relatively recent graduate from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln journalism school and current freelance reporter. Although my prospective career in STEM never panned out, my dream has remained the same since those early days, albeit with a widened lens: to reign in complex, fascinating topics and make them digestible for the average person, and to show how issues halfway around the globe can affect each of us in tangible ways. Since then, I've spent time exploring public health through a data-focused lens for the Wichita Beacon as well as delving into local government for the Norfolk Daily News, although these days, I'm a free agent working out of my hometown of Omaha, NE.

Above all else, I'm seeking to recognize the complexity of issues affecting regular people, instead of reducing them into binary, divisive litmus tests of pre-packaged political ideology. I strive to bring an analytical approach to my work, even in stories where hard numbers might not apply. It's often easy to lose sight of real-life experiences in the presence of so many numbers, and so perhaps most importantly, I'm striving to maintain the human voices underpinning every great story. 

I've also worked on innovating novel applications of simple technology in the realm of data journalism, most recently in cooperation with UNL Professor Matt Waite on sensor-based coding project seeking to visualize the physical experience of attending large-crowd activities, such as sporting events and concerts.

Here's a couple of my favorite pieces I've done far:
* An [investigation](https://journalstar.com/news/local/nebraska-among-states-with-highest-number-of-train-derailments-data-shows/article_69553520-b60a-11ed-bfaa-13387cb4ca5c.html) into train derailments in Nebraska, linking decades-long trends to recent derailments in the state as well as the disaster in East Palestine, OH. 
* [Exploring](https://nebraskanewsservice.net/news/experts-former-residents-offer-varied-reasons-for-nebraskas-brain-drain-as-rates-continue-to-rise/) the root causes behind rising rates of outmigration and brain drain in Nebraska, from consulting the data to examining a diverse range of perspectives on the issue.
* A one-year [retrospective](https://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/students-reflect-on-fall-2021-fiji-protests-ongoing-challenges-facing-unl/article_e4fe207a-48ea-11ed-8537-b36945a30db1.html) on the response to allegations of sexual assault of a 17-year-old girl at a fraternity house on campus, which sparked nationwide outrage.
* [Linking](https://norfolkdailynews.com/news/global-food-shortage-leaves-local-nonprofit-high-and-dry/article_f74cd86e-dd03-11ec-bb4a-5b57750fe06d.html) the war in Ukraine and subsequent global grain shortages to the struggles of a Norfolk, NE-based non-profit's efforts to feed the hungry across the world.
* Covering a petition [drive](https://norfolkdailynews.com/news/conflicting-camps-debate-merits-of-medical-marijuana-legalization-in-nebraska-ahead-of-petition-deadline/article_84d8f4fa-fa10-11ec-a91c-e75f5e1ee325.html) to legalize medical marijuana in Nebraska in the summer of 2022, showing the compelling cases that were being made for and against the initiative.
