### Hey there!

I'm Sawyer Belair, a relatively recent graduate from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln journalism school and current freelance reporter. Although my prospective career in STEM never panned out, my dream has remained the same since those early days, albeit with a widened lens: to reign in complex, fascinating topics and make them digestible for the average person. Since graduating, I've spent time exploring public health through a data-focused lens for the Wichita Beacon as well as delving into local government for the Norfolk Daily News. These days, I'm a free agent working out of my hometown of Omaha, NE.

Above all else, I'm seeking to recognize the complexity of issues affecting regular people, instead of reducing them into binary, divisive litmus tests of pre-packaged political ideology. I strive to bring an analytical approach to my work, even in stories where hard numbers might not apply. It's often easy to lose sight of real-life experiences in the presence of so many numbers, and so perhaps most importantly, I'm striving to maintain the human voices underpinning every great story. 

Here's a couple of my favorite pieces I've done so far:
* An [interview](https://norfolkdailynews.com/news/shanghai-man-stops-in-norfolk-on-worldwide-bike-ride-to-push-the-bounds-of-the/article_a5fa94a0-50e3-11ef-bbcb-23f7fe81a93b.html) with a man from Shanghai, China biking across the world with no money and relying solely on the generosity of others to sustain him, exploring what he seeks to accomplish with the journey.
* [Exploring](https://thebeaconnews.org/stories/2023/10/24/82000-kansans-lost-medicaid-coverage-since-may-how-can-they-get-back-on/) the causes behind the recent trend of Medicaid expulsions in Kansas and how its effected residents, as well as possible solutions for those facing termination of vitally needed coverage.
* An [overview](https://thebeaconnews.org/stories/2023/09/19/500-dead-from-fentanyl-drug-overdose-since-2018-in-wichita/) of the ongoing opioid overdose epidemic in Wichita, including how two parents of an overdose victim have advocated for change and how other community stakeholders are tackling the issue.
* [Investigating](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dy-KqSsmbTJAxPZFkneQ_U-7zgTv-kAJXM7iRqF2MWM/edit?usp=sharing) train derailments in Nebraska, linking decades-long trends to recent derailments in the state as well as the disaster in East Palestine, OH. This story was later cited in a 2023 state legislative committee hearing by supporters of a mandated proposed two-operator minimum for trains operating within state lines.
* A [profile](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FFbPDpO4Jt9G8UnlGjgikC-rIm_Hc40iuhY_suG4uDA/edit?usp=sharing) on Marlina Bowdery, a Lincoln business owner who transformed the grief from the loss of her son to gun violence in 2020 into a page that connects other grieving mothers, as well as a few stories from some of the women she's become close with through the group.
